# Gateway Service PRD

## Overview

The Gateway Service acts as the entry point for all client requests, routing them to appropriate services.

## Objectives

- Provide a single entry point for client applications
- Route requests to appropriate microservices
- Implement basic request validation and logging

## Technical Stack

- **Backend**: Java 17, Spring Cloud Gateway
- **Database**: MongoDB (for configuration)
- **Logging**: SLF4J with Logback

## Functional Requirements

### Request Routing

- Route incoming HTTP requests to appropriate microservices
- Support path-based routing (e.g., /users/** to User Service)
- Handle routing configuration from database or properties file

### Basic Request Processing

- Add correlation IDs to all requests for tracing
- Log basic request information (path, method, timestamp)
- Forward authentication tokens to downstream services

### Error Handling

- Return appropriate error responses (4xx, 5xx)
- Provide basic error messages without exposing system details
- Implement circuit breaker for failing services

## Data Schema

```
RouteConfig {
  id: ObjectId
  path: String
  targetService: String
  enabled: Boolean
  createdAt: Date
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

## API Endpoints

- All endpoints from other services (acts as proxy)
- GET /api/health - Health check endpoint
- GET /api/routes - Admin only: list active routes

## Success Metrics

- Average response time < 200ms
- Gateway service uptime > 99.9%
- Successful routing rate > 99%
